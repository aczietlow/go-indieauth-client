- [x] complete url canonicalization
- [x] Move on to creating the client authorization request
  - The client builds the authorization request including its 
    - [x] client identifier, 
    - [x] requested scope, 
    - [x] state
    - [x] code_verify, code_challenge, code_challenge_method
    - [x] redirect URI.
  - [x] Then redirect the browser to the authorization endpoint with the constructed request
    - [ ] If possible, keep echo server logic within the website implementation and the client implementation agnostic.
    - [x] Test with indieAuth.net
      - [x] Will need a valid URL for testing this. Localhost is denied by the spec and implementation 
    - [x] Refactor HTMX to make more sense 
      - Won't be able to have a SPA. At least not right this minute.
- [x] Complete the token exchange on redirect from the Auth Server
  - [x] Create state layer in memory
    - Guess we can have a storage layer later
  - [x] Validate state matches request sent
  - [x] Build HTTP request to token endpoint
  - [x] Make HTTP Request to endpiont
  - [x] Validate response from endpoint
    - Currently fighting with this. Getting "Error when attempting to exchange the token: Application type was application/x-www-form-urlencoded Body response: error=invalid_request&error_description=Missing+%27code%27+parameter"
    - Need to figure what is getting sent. Maybe the json is wrong, or the code parameter is blank.
  - [x] Perform Authorization Server Confirmation
  - [x] Hold on to access token
  - [x] display in browser
- [ ] Read Oauth [spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1) for indicating errors, and make a pass at cleaning up code base.
- [x] Break flow of redirects
  - [x] Discovery request should display to the user to show values returned; Show authorization request URL to the user
  - [ ] Using middleware, capture the actual http requests and response for output client side
  - [ ] Actually output these client side
  - [x] Find a way to show the client app verifying authorization code and validating identifier
  - [x] Show the user the access token expiration date
- [x] Split the receiving of the authorization code and exchanging it for a token into multiple steps
- [x] Actually use the access token for "something"
- [x] Validate user access tokens via the indieAuth server

Post MVP
- [ ] Add support to indieAuthClient to look for auth metadata endpoint
- [ ] Add functionality to indieAuthClient to follow auth metadata URL, parse json, and return the auth and token endpoints
- [ ] Allow for composable [scopes](https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#profile-information-li-1). No need to force profile and email all the time.
- [ ] Add additional code-challenge methods other than SHA256
- [ ] refactor indieAuth config file. Currently, am duplicating a thing
- [ ] Grab a refresh Token
- [ ] Build indieAuth Server Authorization Endpoint to respond to authorization requests
- [ ] Fix error handling on the form. Replace instances of `formData.Errors["url"]`
- [ ] Create a wizard like form flow
- [ ] Make scopes selectable in the form
